**About Me**

My name is Lakshmanjee, and I enjoy listening to music and working on hands-on technical projects, especially those involving sensors and hardware. I come from an Electronics and Communication Engineering background, where I developed a strong interest in building practical systems and understanding how different components work together in real-world applications.

**Computer Experience**

My academic background is in Electronics and Communication Engineering, and most of my experience comes from sensor-based and hardware-focused projects. I have written programs for integrating sensors using Arduino and collaborated on projects such as a vehicle pollution control and tracking system, which involved using multiple sensors to monitor and track environmental data. I also built a small educational website as part of an undergraduate project, which introduced me to web development and motivated me to learn how websites work practically rather than only at a theoretical level.

** Using What I Learn in This Course**

I see myself using the concepts from this course to build real, functional websites and applications that connect software with real-world use cases. My goal is to strengthen my understanding of web technologies and apply them to future projects, including larger systems that may integrate data, hardware, and software together. The skills learned in this course will help me build structured, organized, and scalable projects as I move forward academically and professionally.
